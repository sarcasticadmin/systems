# First log in

1. Clone down dotfiles and stow for appropriate config:

```
git git@github.com:sarcasticadmin/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make CONFIG=./_make/workstation-pkgs.mk world
```

2. Log out (alt+shift+e) and log back into i3

## Known Issues

- wpa_supplicant.conf gets copied to /run/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf during service start. Resulting in the inability to actually update /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

- wpa_supplicant defaults to the wrong interface (p2p). Have had to specify which interface for `wpa_cli` via `-i <interface>`

- Check to make sure the interface is actually enabled, sometimes the hardware button (F8) is disabling the wifi card. You can notice this in
  the `wpa_cli status` since it will say `DISABLE_INTERFACE`

- pinentry is not present for the binary I was execting. Seems to be only ncurses pinentry is available, maybe make a new drv upstream?
